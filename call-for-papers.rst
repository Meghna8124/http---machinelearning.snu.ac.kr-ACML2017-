The 8th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2016) will be held at the
University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand on November 16-18, 2016. The
conference aim is to provide a leading international forum for researchers in
machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progresses and
achievements. Submissions from regions other than the Asia-Pacific are highly
encouraged.

The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory
and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals
focusing on frontier research, new ideas and new paradigms in machine learning.


Submission
----------

This year we are running **two publication tracks**: Authors may submit either to
the **conference track**, for which the proceedings will be published as a volume
of Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR): `Workshop and Conference
Proceedings <http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/>`__ series, or to the
**journal track** for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of
the `Springer journal Machine Learning <http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994>`__.

**Please note that submission arrangements for the two tracks are different.**

Conference track
++++++++++++++++

For the conference track please submit your manuscript via CMT at:

https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ACML2016

**Submissions to the conference track will reopen on Monday July 4th.**

Please be aware that ACML runs two submission rounds to the conference track:
The first round can result in an Accept, Reject or Conditional Acceptance (i.e.
subject to changes made by the second round) decision. There is no author
rebuttal phase in this round.
The second round has the more usual Accept or Reject outcomes and does include
an author rebuttal phase.

Papers will be published in a dedicated volume of the JMLR Workshop &
Conference Proceedings. Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of
16 pages (including references, appendices etc.) and follow the JMLR W&CP
style. If required supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file,
but reviewers are not obligated to consider this, and your manuscript should
therefore stand on its own merits without any supplementary material.

You can download a suitable Latex template and style file from `here
</ACML2016_template.zip>`__.

Submissions must have all detail identifying the author(s) removed from the
original manuscript.

**Submissions that are overlength, not in the correct format, or contain clear
identifying detail - for example the authors' names below the title - will be
rejected without review.**

Journal track
+++++++++++++

For the journal track please submit via Springer's Editorial Manager system at:

https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach

Log in as Author, click on Submit New Manuscript, and select S.I.: ACML 2016
from the Choose Article Type drop-down list.
Papers will be published in a special issue of Machine Learning. Manuscripts
must be written in English; please follow the instructions for authors at:

http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994

There is no specific page limit for journal submissions, however **papers
accepted to the journal track must still be presented at the conference in order to
be published**, therefore it must be possible to describe at least the major
parts of your submission in a talk of around 20 minutes duration.
